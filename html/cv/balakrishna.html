He contested in the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election and won the Hindupur Assembly Constituency seat with a reasonable majority. He also won again in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, consecutively.[43] Hindupur, in Anantapur district, has been a stronghold for TDP since the formation of the party in 1983. It was once represented by his father and later for a term by his elder brother, Nandamuri Harikrishna. Balakrishna is the third member from the family to represent it in the State Assembly..</p>
